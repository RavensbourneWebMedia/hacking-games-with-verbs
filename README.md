# Paper-prototype socially responsive games with verbs

![Poster](https://raw.github.com/matteomenapace/paper-prototype-socially-responsive-games-with-verbs/master/images/poster.jpg)

This is the **recipe for a workshop** I presented at the [Mozilla Festival 2012](http://lanyrd.com/szkmy). 

My recipe was forked from the one [Paolo Pedercini](http://www.molleindustria.org) and [Una Lee](http://unalee.net/) prepared for the [Allied Media Conference](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/a-computerless-videogame-modding-workshop/), and inspired by [Grow-a-Game](http://www.tiltfactor.org/grow-a-game).

Please take this recipe and try it at home, with your class, club or organization, and share your results with all people _upstream_.


## Introduction

**This workshop is about hacking the rules of existing videogames in response to topical issues, and prototyping new games that are vessels of alternative values and messages.**

Working in small teams, participants receive two creative constraints:

1. a classic arcade **game**, such as Super Mario Bros, Pac-man, or Space Invaders
2. a topical **issue**, such as the financial crisis, global climate change, or digital literacy

The first task is to **analyse the game verbs**: what actions players can do, how they can interact with game characters or other players, what they should do to win the game, and what they simply can’t do. Participants explore how these verbs express messages and values, ideas and ideologies. 

Then they **redesign the game so that it is about the issue**, using a different set of verbs that reflect the values and views of the team. Participants are encouraged to consider changing the _gameplay_[<sup id="s1">1</sup>](#f1), as well as the goal(s) and narrative of the game.

Each team is provided with a collection of **pre-cut paper props** ripped from the assigned game, which they use to discuss and prototype alternative gameplays, as opposed to simply re-skin[<sup id="s2">2</sup>](#f2) the game.

## Ingredients

Before the workshop I prepared:

1. a **[short presentation](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1m7CVKpsHk38UXiyCIBv-sBtNZ8g2rHZFVbVGsoLd59Q)** to be delivered in a _kamishibai_[<sup id="s3">3</sup>](#f3) fashion, scribbling key concepts on a flip chart as I introduce them to participants, asking them questions and fostering an open discussion. Besides, the hands-on nature of the workshop makes digital slides inappropriate. 
2. a set of **printed [game cards](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1DYXX_zd00e4yhfxbLL84EORXN62MHZJxXhzBNnrERHo)**, each of them including a visual reference, a short explanation and a few questions to help teams analyse their game
3. a set of **printed [issue cards](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1_kOZeI-p9bCzXj-4HrM9btvAkDCMp56qqSqSv3wdRCU)**, each of them including related keywords and an example scenario to stimulate different takes on the issue
4. a **printed [brainstorming cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1I_SWb14II4QjzaI9PymAwy21d-bhj42FW1Z3Ab99WG8)** with tips and questions to help team discussion
5. a set of **printed props** for people to use as main movable visual modules when prototyping their new gameplays. Physical paper pieces compel participants to reason in visual and spatial terms. They also allow for a more democratic process, since all team members can rearrange elements as if they were working on a jigsaw puzzle

Additional materials needed for the paper-prototyping activity:

* large format **paper**, A2 or bigger
* **sharpies** in various tints
* **post-its** in different colours
* **scissors**
* **glue** sticks

### The elevator pitch

In the joyful chaos of an event like the [Mozilla Festival](http://mozillafestival.org/), you need a short and engaging workshop description to attract people.
 
As [advertised on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/szkmy/):

> This session will allow you to **prototype a videogame** starting with something we are all familiar with: verbs! Whether it is running or collecting, shooting or trading, **games are driven by verbs**. We will look at classic games in terms of verbs and explore how these verbs express messages and values. Then we will **hack these games**, changing the verbs so that they express our own messages and values.


## Method

Modifying (or modding) pre-existing games prevents participants from spending too much time thinking about the “kind” of game they deem more appropriate. It also pushes them to deconstruct the rhetoric and the ideological biases that inform commercial games.



We thought it was important to describe issues as tensions and not only as negative or positive values to stimulate a variety of approach. Games can represent a problem, envision a solution, embody an interpersonal dynamic that resonates with the scenario and so on.

The scenario is meant to be an example. Participants were able to choose to approach the problem in an abstract way (e.g. Economic Inequality) or in more geographically or historically specific way (e.g. the Downsizing of Detroit along class and racial lines) or anything in between. 















## Outcomes


1. #### MARIO + POWER of MONEY:
Princess Toadstool is in debt, and Mario has to bail her out. The more time passes, the bigger her debt grows.
So you set out to gather money and keep up with repayments, while the game keeps throwing moral dilemmas at you: mug people or burgle houses for quick bucks, or go the slower legitimate way of earning money with hard work? This idea sparkled from the thought that actions in the original Mario have no consequences, you keep jumping over turtles and breaking bricks, collecting coins that can't be traded.

2. #### BOMBERMAN + DIGITAL LITERACY, re-titled NETWORKMAN:
You have Internet connection, but your friends don't. Your first goal is to get them connected, so that you can start building things together. So you set out to find cable and build a physical network, but the network thieves drop bombs to destroy your connections. When you connect another player, they can help you make the network stronger and unlock new challenges to build the Open Web.

3. #### PAC-MAN + ENERGY:
You (Pac-man) want to be energy efficient, but energy corporations want you to waste it. Your goal is to get out of each level's maze by consuming the least amount of energy (dots), while the shiny gadgets and juicy appliances that are thrown at you to increase your bill. This game subverts the Pac-man gameplay by turning its endless hunger and pointless accumulation into a strategic avoidance


### The party bag

These are some of the general outcomes that people can take home from this workshop:

* develop a critical thinking approach to entertainment commodities
* practice team work in a playfully structured activity
* develop a methodology that can be applied to game design and user experience design in general, using constraints to channel your creative response
* leave with a prototyped concept, which you can develop further, digitally as a video game or physically as a board game
* organize similar hack-a-game sessions, independently, in the future 


### What worked

* examples of outcomes (eg: PAC-MAN + BULLYING = Pac-Man is a student, bullied by ghosts. Some of them pick on his skin colour, others on his insatiable hunger. In order to defeat the different types of bullies, you needed different skills)
* walk through the process step by step
* mid-session presentations (to check on other groups thought process to inform your teamwork)

### What didn’t work

* title too long and off-putting (need something snappier like Inject videogames with positive values?)
* title not #hashtaggable (Metod suggests #games-with-verbs)

### Suggestions

* divide the deconstructing the game phase from the injecting issue part, so that people focus on the game first and then on the issue
* state clearly that the example scenario is only an example but groups could come up with any other scenario where the issue manifests itself
* different colours for different parts? (eg: green Post-its for verbs that are present, yellow Post-its for verbs that are not present, pink for values, etc..)
* 3 minutes constraint for the final presentation, forces you to simplify the game
