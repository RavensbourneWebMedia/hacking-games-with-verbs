# Hacking rules, rather than stories

It's rather easy to add a new narrative layer to the game, whilst changing the gameplay is more challenging.

Can we find examples of hacked gameplays, where parts of the original gameplay have been kept and the rules have changed to create a new gaming experience? To show that this exercise is not about changing the back-story or the skin of an existing game, but rather changing its rules.

# Remember the verbs?

Must include **new verbs**, that is: new possibilities for gameplay. 

Could also exclude current verbs, forcing the gameplay to change.

# Issues

These are fine as a starting point, keep them broad and perhaps offer a few conversation starters

* What do you know about this issue?
* Is anyone you know affected by it?
* Could you (or your friends/family) be affected in the future?
* How do you feel about this issue?

# Values or morals?

Morals seem to be more *actionable*.

How about we ask them to specifically state what the moral(s) of the modded game will be, before they start prototyping?

How about we get them to discuss the issue before the game?
