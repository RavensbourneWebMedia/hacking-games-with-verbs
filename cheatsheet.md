## (1) DECONSTRUCTING THE GAME

### Questions to your game analysis

* what **verbs** are used in the game?
* can you think of any other relevant verbs or dynamics that **could have been included** in the game?
* what **messages** does the game communicate?
* what **values** does it embody?    
 
## (2) HACKING THE GAME

### You have an issue and a game.
### Redesign the game so that it is about the issue.

Do this by using a **different set of verbs** that reflect the values and views of your team.

Verbs will be the building blocks of your new game, but consider also how you can change the **gameplay** (its system of rules and the way players interact with characters and objects), the game **goal** and its **narrative**.

Your new game may look similar but will play very differently than the original!

### Questions to help your new game design

* what are your team’s views in relation to the issue?
* what are your team’s values in relation to the issue?
* what are some verbs that reflect those values and views?
* who are the characters involved in the issue?
* how do they interact with each other?
* who is the player in your new game?
* what is/are the player’s role(s) in the issue?   
* what is the goal of the new game?   
* is it a collaborative game or a competitive game?
* is it a multiplayer or a single-player game?
