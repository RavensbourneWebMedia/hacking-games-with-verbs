# 1. Break down the game

### Verbs > messages > morals

* What **verbs** are used in the game?
* Can you think of any other relevant verbs or dynamics that **Could have been included** in the game?
* What **messages** does the game communicate?
* What **morals** does it embody? 

Think about the actions the game wants you to take in order to win it: that may give you a hint of its **messages and morals**. 
  You don't have to agree with those morals.
 
# 2. Hack the game

### You have an issue and a game.
### Redesign the game so that it is about the issue.

Do this by using a **different set of verbs** that reflect the values and views of your team.

Verbs will be the building blocks of your new game, but consider also how you can change the **gameplay** (its system of rules and the way players interact with characters and objects), the game **goal** and its **narrative**.

Your new game may look similar but will play very differently than the original!

### Questions to help your new game design

* What are your team's views in relation to the issue?
* What are some verbs that reflect those views?
* Who are the characters involved in the issue?
* How do they interact with each other?
* Who is the player in your new game?
* What is/are the player's role(s) in the issue?   
* What is the goal of the new game?   
* Is it a collaborative game or a competitive game?
* Is it a multiplayer or a single-player game?
