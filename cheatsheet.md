# 1. Discuss the issue

* What do you know about this issue?
* How do you feel about this issue?
* Is anyone you know affected by it?
* Could you (or your friends/family) be affected in the future?

Jot down **messages** you want to communicate and **behaviours** you want to promote in relation to the issue.


# 2. Break down the game

### Verbs > messages > morals

* What **verbs** are used in the game? 
* Can you think of any other verbs that **could have been included** in the game?
* What **messages** do these verbs communicate?
* What **morals** (aka *good behaviours* ) does the game promote, more or less explicitly?

Think about the actions the game wants you to take in order to win it. That may give you a hint of its **messages and morals**. 
  You don't have to agree with those morals.


# 3. Hack the game

### You have an issue and a game.

### Redesign the game so that it is about the issue.

Do this by using a **different set of verbs** which reflect the messages and behaviours your team wants to promote.

Focus on changing the **gameplay** (the system of rules and the ways players interact with characters and game resources), rather than *reskinning* the game.

An easy way to force a change of gameplay is by including **new verbs**, and excluding current verbs.

Your new game may look similar but will play very differently than the original!

### Questions to help your new game design

In no particular order:

* What are the **messages** you want to communicate and **behaviours** you want to promote in relation to the issue? What are some **verbs** that could carry those messages and behaviours?
* What real-life **system** could your game simulate? Which parts of the system could you focus on? And which elements of the system would you leave out?
* Who are the **characters** involved in the issue? How do they interact with each other? Who are the *goodies* and the *baddies*?
* Who is the **player** (or who are the player**s**) in your new game? What is/are the player's role(s) in the *issue*?   
* What role do players play in the *game*? Is it a power fantasy or a disempowered role, or something in between?
* What is the **goal** of the new game? 
* What are the **rules** of the new game? How do players interact with these rules?  
* Is the new game **collaborative** or **competitive**?
* Is the new game **multiplayer** or **single-player**? 
* Is there a **story** to provide meaning to the game?
